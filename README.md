# 7. [Pointers and Parameters](V)

#	* [Pointers and Parameters](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

For starters, we will introduce the concept of pointers, also known as **references**
Pointers make all modern software possible.

# * [what is a pointer](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

In programming, pointers are **references** to other things. 
When you declare a variable in C, memory is allocated to hold its value. This memory has a specific, numeric address. C pointers are special variables, specifically designed to hold one of these addresses.

# * [Why use pointers](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Pointers can be extremely useful, allowing you to access your data in ways that ordinary variables just don't allow. 

# * [Checking out of the Library](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

In this chapter stars to explaining how a book in a bookstore can be found it.
What really is important to say is that the use of pointers in your C programs is not much different from those models of how a books is find it. Each catalog number points to the location of a book on the library shelf, just as each street address identifies a specific house. In the same way, each pointer in your program will point to the location off a piece of data in computer memory

There is a lot you can do with pointers. By mastering the techniques presented in these next few chapters, you will be able to create programs that take full advantage of pointers

# * [Pointers Basics](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Pointers are address variables. Instead of an address such as 1313 Mockingbird Lane, Raven Heights, California 90263, a variable's address refers to a memory location within your computer. Your computer's memory -also known as **random access memory** (RAM)- consist of a sequence of bytes. One megabyte of RAM has exactly 2^30 (or 1,048,576) bytes of memory, while 8 megabytes of RAM has exactly 8(2^20) = 2^23 = 8,388,608 bytes of memory. 

2^4 = 16
2^8 = 256
2^16 = 65,536
2^32 = 4,294,967,296	that's why my old hp pavilion of 32 bits ran with 4GB of ram memory
2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616	 That's why my macbook of 64 bits can run with 16GB of ram memory

By other hand, the book treats the memory as arbitrary numbers like 1MB of ram, 8 MB of RAM, etc. This does not exist commercially, at least not when I was studying.


Every one of those bytes has a unique **address**.

# * [The address of a Variable](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

When you run a program, one of the first things the computer does is allocate memory for your program's variables. When you declare and Int in your code, like this:

```c
int variable;
```

The compiler reserves memory for the exclusive use of **variable**.

**Note**: As mentioned earlier in this book, the amount of memory allocated for an Int depends on your development environment, Xcode currently defaults to using 4-byte ints.

Each variable's bytes has a specific address. Figure 7-4 shows the computer's 1 gigabyte of memory.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-29 at 12 38 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/83288670-5e307380-a1a9-11ea-84bd-4a31506c2051.png)

In this picture, the 4 bytes allocated to variable have he addresses 836, 837, 838 and 839.

By convention, a variable's address is said to be the address of its first byte (the first byte is the byte with the lowest numbered address). If a variable uses memory locations 936 through 839, its address is 836 and its length is 4 bytes.

**Note**: When a variable occupies more than 1 byte of memory, he bytes are always consecutive (next to each other in memory). You will never see an int whose byte adresses are 508, 509, 510 and 695. A variable's bytes are like family, they stick together.

As we showed earlier, a variable's address is a lot like the library catalog number in a library book's catalog entry. Both act as pointers, one to  book on the library self and the other to a variable. From now on, when we use the term "pointer" with respect to a variable, we referring to the variable's address.

Now that you understand what a pointer is, you next goal is to learn how to use pointers in your programs. The next few sections will teach you some valuable pointer programming skills. You will learn how to create a pointer to a variable.

The C language provides you with a few key tools to help yo. These tools come in the form of two special operators: & and \*.

# * [The & operator](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

The & operator, called **address of** operator, is a unary operator that pairs with a variable name to produce the variable's address. The expression:

```c
variable
```

retrieves the value store in the **variable** variable, while the expresion:

```c
&variable
```

refers to variable's address in memory. If **variable** occupied memory locations 836through 839 (as in figure 7-4), the expression %variable would have a value of 836. The expression $variable is a pointer to the variable **variable**.

An expression like &variable is a common way to obtain the address of a variable. But what ca you do with that address ? Store it into a pointer variable, of course! **A pointer variable is a variable specifically designed to hold the address of another variable.

# * [Declaring a Pointer Variable](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

C supports a special notation for declaring pointer variables. The following line declares a pointer variable named *pointer:

```c
int *pointer;
```

The * is not part of the variable's name. Instead, it tells the compiler that the associated variable is a pointer, specifically designed to hold the address of an int variable. Technically, when * appears in a declaration it is a **type modifier**, not an operator. It modifies the int variable declaration and turns it into and int pointer variable declaration. Simply stated, int integer means **"allocate a variable that will hold an integer", while "int *ingeter" means "Allocate a variable that will hold the memory address of a variable that holds an integer." If there was a data type called **bluto**, you could declare a variable designed to point to a **bluto** like this:

```c
bluto *blutoPointer;
```

For the moment, we will limit ourselves to pointers that pointst o ints. Look at this code:

```c
int *pointer, variable;
pointer = &variable
```

The variable declaration allocates two variables: a pointer to an int, and an int. The assignment statement puts variable's address in the variable **pointer**. If variable's address is 836, this code will leave **pointer** with a value of 836. Note that this code has absolutely no effect on the value of **variable**

We are sure you have got the concept of memory address, and you understand that every value stored in memory has an address associated with it. You now know how to obtain that address of a variable with the address-of (&) operator and store that address in a pointer variable (a variable for storing memory addresses)

so now what ?. This is where pointers start to get interesting.


# * [The * Operator](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

The complement to the **address-of** (&) operator is the unary * or **indirection operator**. It does just the opposite of the & operator. It takes a pointer variable and turns it into the variable the pointer variable points to. Confusing, isn't it ?
Here is a simple example

---
**Note**
The * operator officially name in the C standard is the "indirection pointer", but it is also commonly referred to as the "start", "pointer" or "dereference operator"
---

```c
int *pointer;
int variable;

variable = 3;
pointer = &variable
*pointer = 27;
```

The first assignment statement (variable = 3) makes perfect sense. You have been using that form since Chapter 2. The second assignment statement is only a slight variation of the first. It is still storing a value into the variable named on the left side of the assignment operator (=), but this time the value is a memory address. At this point, pointer holds the address of variable. So far, so good.

The third assignment statement is the game changer. It copies the value 27 into the memory address pointer to by pointer.

The indirection operator (*) takes the value stored in pointer and treats it like the address of a variable. In other words, the computer will take the memory address stored in the variable pointer and use it to locate the int variable somewhere else in memory, and then store the value 27 there. It still contains the address of variable.

If pointer contains the address of variable, as is the case in our example, referring to *pointer is equivalent to referring to variable. For example, this line

```c
*pointer = 27
```

Is the same as this one:

```c
variable = 27
```

Still confused? Don't worry, we are going to walk through this again with illustration Figure 7.5 joins our program in progress, just after the variables variable and pointer were declared:

```c
int *pointer, variable;
```
![Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 19 29 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/83341698-fa42a380-a2ab-11ea-943f-dde1c1c136fb.png)

Once memory is allocated for **variable** and **pointer**, you move n to the statement:

```c
pointer = &variable;
```

The address of the variable **variable** is stored in the 8 bytes allocated to **pointer**. In this example, **variable** address is 836. Now, **pointer** is said to **point to variable** See figure 7-6

![Screen Shot 2020-05-31 at 16 07 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/83362694-d8532a80-a358-11ea-9981-02dfcd7d6aa1.png)

Ok, you are almost there. The next line of the example writes the value 27 to the location pointer to by **pointer**.

```c
*pointer = 27
```

Without the * operator, the computer would place the value 27 in the memory allocated to **pointer**. The * operator ^**dereferences** **pointer**. Dereferencing a pointer turns the pointer into the variable it points to. Figure 7-7 shows the end results.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-31 at 16 11 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/83362771-65967f00-a359-11ea-99df-30d311f306a0.png)

If you step through the 07.01 - Pointer object with the debugger, you can watch each of these steps happen. Of course, the address of **variable** will not be 836, but other that that everything else should be consistent with the illustration.

The workplace window, shown in Figure 7-8, shows the values of **pointer** and **variable**. The Xcode debugger conveniently adds and expansion triangle next to pointer values. Which let you easily see the value that they point to. This will become really useful as you continue to explore pointers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    int variable = 27;
    int *pointer;
    
    pointer = &variable;
    
    printf("the value of variable is %d\n", variable);
    printf("the value of variable is %d\n", *pointer);
    
    printf("the value of pointer is: %p\n", pointer);
    printf("the address of variable is: %p\n", &variable);
    
    *pointer = 27;
    printf("the new value of variable is %d\n", variable);
    
    return 0;
}
```

```console
the value of variable is 27
the value of variable is 27
the value of pointer is: 0x7ffeefbff34c
the address of variable is: 0x7ffeefbff34c
the new value of variable is 27
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

# * [Computer Architecture and Pointer Sizes](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

If you are curious to know why an int variable takes up 4 bytes of memory and a pointer variable takes up 8 bytes of memory, read on.

As of this writing, the default size for an int variable is 4 bytes, or 32 bits is enough to represent any whole number between 0 and 4,294,967,295. If this is not perfectly clear, review the section "Size of a Type" in [Chapter 4]().

A pointer variable is, essentially, an integer variable that stores the address of a byte in memory. Logically, it has to be big enough to represent all of the possible memory addresses your computer has. That means that every pointer variable in a program has to be capable of storing a number between 0 and the last address, since a variable can (theoretically) be allocated at any memory address.

If you shopped for a shiny new Mac recently, you know that (with some spare cash) it is not difficult to load it up with more than 4GB of RAM. A 32-bit(4 byte) integer can only represent number between 0 and 4,294,967,295 (4GB). Clearly, that is inadequate for today's computers.

Modern CPUs use 64-bit (8 byte) pointers. This allows a pointer to store the address of any memory location between 0 and 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 -yikes, that is a big number! It works out to 16 exabytes, or 16 billion gigabytes - a really, really, big number, and way more RAM than you can afford,

The size of pointers is intimately tied to he computer's hardware. Back in the days of the original Apple II, micro-computers used 16-bit pointers. Simply stated, it means the CPU could directly address 65,536 memory locations (64K). Hey, it seemed like a lot at the time.

Not surprisingly, it was not very long before this was not enough. By the time the original Mac was introduced, CPUs were starting to use 32 bits pointers. The Motorola 68000 processor in the original Mac could, theoretically, address up to 4GB of RAM. Of course, no one made memory modules that big and you could not install that much RAM on the motherboard even if you could get your hands on it. But for programmers, it meant that pointer variables were now 4 bytes long

Fast-forward 30 years and the 4GB of addresses that seemed almost inexhaustible in the 1980s looks puny now. CPU design has, naturally, been trying to keep up and desktop computers have now largely transitioned to using 64-bit (8byte) pointers. Again, that does not mean you can actually install 16 exabytes of RAM in your Mac, but a program that uses 64 bit pointers will run on such a system.

64-bit pointers should hold us for some time to come. To put it in perspective, if the surface of a Popsicle stick represents all of the memory that 32-bit pointer can address, a 64-bit pointer can address the surface area of the golden gate bridge. Given the exponential rate that memory density increasing, and computer programs keep using more memory, the transition from 32 to 64 bit pointers should hold us for about 90 years. Of course, we will not be surprised if your great grandchildren are one day shaking their heads wondering how we ever got by with "only" 16 exabytes of addressable memory.

# * [Function Parameters](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

We are going to take a short break from pointers and talk about functions and how to exchange values with them. How does this relate to pointers ? Be patient, as we will come back around to that soon enough.

Suppose you want to write a function called **AddTwo()** that takes two numbers, adds them together, an returns the sum of the two numbers. How do you get the two original numbers to **AddTwo()**? How do you get the sum of the two numbers back to the function that called **AddTwo()**

The answer to the first question is **function parameters** or **values passed** to a function. The second question is answered with a **return value**, or a **value passed** from the function back to the caller of that function. Before you can learn how to pass values around, or even why you need to, you need to know a little about the concept of scope.

# * [Variable Scope](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

In C, every variable is said to have a **scope**. A variable's scope defines where in the program you have access to that variable. In other words, if a variable is declared inside one function, can another function refer to that same variable ?

Simply stated, the scope of a variable is defined by where it is declared. The scope of a variable declared inside a function is limited to the code inside that function.

---
**Note**
Technically, the scope of a variable declared inside any block ({}) of code ends at the closing brace of that block
---

This definition is important. It means you can't declare a variable inside one function, and then refer to that same variable inside another function. Here's an example that will never compile:

```c
int main (int argc, const char *argv[])
{
	int numberOfDots;
	numberOfDots = 500;
	DrawDots();
	return 0;
}

void DrawDots(void) 
{
	int index;
	for (index = 1; index <= numberOfDots; index`++) 
		printf(".")
}
```

The error in this code occurs when the function **DrawDots()** tries to reference the variable **numberOfDots**. According to the rules of scope. **DrawDots()** does not even know about the variable **numberOfDots**. If you tried to compile this program, the compiler would complain that **DrawDots()** tried to use the variable **numberOfDots** without declaring it.

The problem you are faced with is getting the value of **numberOfDots** to the function DrawDots() so DrawDots() knows how many dots to draw. The answer to this problem is function parameters.

---
TIP
**DrawDots()** is another example of the value of writing functions. We have taken the code needed to perform a specific function (in this case, draw some dots) and embedded it in a function. Now, instead of having to duplicate the code inside **DrawDots()** every time we want to draw some dots in our program, all we need is a single line of code: a call to the function **DrawDots()**
---

# * [How Function Parameters Works](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Function **parameters** are variables, but instead of being declared at the beginning of a function, parameters are listed between the parentheses of the function's declaration, like this:

```c
void DrawDots(int numberOfDots)
{
	// function's body goes here
}
```

When you call a function you simply provide a value for each parameter, making sure you pass the function what it expects. To call the version of **DrawDots()** just defined, make sure you place an int between parentheses. The call to **DrawDots** inside **main()** passes the value 30 into the function **DrawDots()**:

```c
int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
	DrawDots(30)
	return 0
}
```

When **DrawDots()** starts executing, it sets its parameter to the passed-on value. In this case, **DrawDots()** has one parameter, and int named **numberOfDots**. When this call executes

```c
DrawDots(30)
```

the function **DrawDots()** set its parameter, **numberOfDots**, to a value of 30.

To make this little clearer, here is a revised version of the example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void DrawDots( int numberOfDots );
int main (int argc, const char * argv[])
{
    DrawDots( 30 );
return 0; }

void DrawDots( int numberOfDots )
{
int i;
for ( i = 1; i <= numberOfDots; i++ ) printf( "." );
}
```

This version of drawDots will compile and run properly. Its starts with the #include of studio.h and follows with the function prototype of **DrawDots()**. Recall the concept of function prototypes that we introduced in Chapter 3. Imagine the compiler making its way down the file, processing one chunk of code at a time. Without the prototype, it would hit the call of DrawDots(30) inside **main()** and not have anything to veryfy it agains. The prototype assures the compiler that you intend to provide a function named DrawDots(), that it will not return a value (that is why it is declared as void), and that it will take and int as an argumnt. As the compiler continues to process the file and comes across the actual call of DrawDots(), it can make an intelligent assessment of the call to decide if it was made properly.

After the DrawDots prototype, you entere **main()**. **main()** calls DrawDots(), passing as a parameter the constant 30. **DrawDots()** receives the value 30 in its int parameter, numberOfDots. This means that the function **DrawDots** starts execution with a variable named **numberOfDots** having a value of 30.

Inside **DrawDots()**, the **for loop** behaves as you might expect, drawing 30 periods in the console window. Figure 7-9 shows a picture of this program in action. You can run this example yourself. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void DrawDots( int numberOfDots );

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    
    int numberOfDots;
    numberOfDots = 500;
    DrawDots(30);
    
    return 0;
}

void DrawDots(int numberOfDots)
{
    int index;
    for (index = 1; index <= numberOfDots; index++)
        printf(".");
    printf("\n");
}
```

output

```console
..............................
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

# * [Parameters are Temporary](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

When a function gets called, a temporary variable is created for each of its parameters. When the function exits (returns to the calling function), that variable goes away.

In the example, we passed a value of 30 into **DrawDots** as a parameter. The value came to rest in the temporary variable named **numberOfDots**. Once **DrawDots** exited, this version of numberOfDots ceased to exist.

---
**Note**
Remember, a variable declared inside a function can only be used inside that function. For this reason, they are often called **local variables**.
---

It is perfectly acceptable for two functions to use the same variable names for completely different purposes. For example, using a variable name like index as a counter in a **for loop** is fairly standard. What happens when, in the middle of just such a **for loop**, you can call a function that also uses a variable named index ? Here is an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void DrawDots( int numberOfDots );

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    
    int numberOfDots;
		int index;

		for(index = 1; index<=10; index++) {
    	DrawDots(30);
			printf("\n");
		} 
    return 0;
}

void DrawDots(int numberOfDots)
{
    int index;
    for (index = 1; index <= numberOfDots; index++)
        printf(".");
    printf("\n");
}
```

This code prints a series of 10 rows of dots, with 30 dots in each row. After each call to **DrawDot()**, carriage return is printed, moving the cursor in position to begin the nest row of dots.

Notice that **main()** and **DrawDots()** each feature a variable named index. **main()** uses the variable index as a counter, tracking the number of rows of dots printed.
**DrawDots()** also uses index as counter, tracking the number of dots in the row it is printing. Will not **DrawDots()'s** copy of index mess up **main()**'s copy of index ? No!

When **main()** starts executing, memory gets allocated for its copy of index. When **main()** calls **DrawDots**, additional memory gets allocated for the DrawDots copy of index. When DrawDots() exits, the memory for its copy of index is deallocated freed up so it can be used again for some variable.

---
**Note**
A parameter or variable declared within a function is known as an **automatic variable**, so called because they are automatically allocated when the function begins, and then automatically deallocated when the function ends. **DrawDots** has a two automatic variables: the variable **index** and the **numberOfDots** parameter.
---

# * [The Difference Between Arguments and Parameters]()

Here is one final point: **The value pased into a function is known as an **argument**. The variable declared to received the argument is known as a **parameter**. In this line of code:

```c
DrawDots(30)
```

The constant 30 is an **argument** being passed to **DrauDots()**; It is not a parameter.

Many programmers use the terms **"Argument"** and **"Parameter"** interchangeably. For example, someone might talk about passing a parameter to a function. Stricly speaking, you pass an argument to a function to be received as a parameter. As long as you understand that point, the term **"parameter passing"** will do just fine.

# * [Function return Value](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Parameters let you copy values to functions, but what about getting values from functions? That is where a function's return value comes into play. A **return value** passes a single value from the function back to the function that called it.

You declare the type of value a function will return right at the beginning of the function's definition. This permits the function to be used in an expression, juts as if the function was a variable of that type. The return statement at the end of the function's body determines what that value will be.

Now we can finally explain the mysterious **return 0**; statement that is been in every example in this book. The function **main** is declared to return and int value:

```c
int main( int argc, const char * argv[] )
```

When **main()** function ends, it returns a value of 0 to whoever called it using statement:

```c
return 0;
```

The function that called **main()** - **start()**, it must knows- receives the value when main() ends. The meaning of the value must be agreed upon in advance. In this case of main(), the value returned is the program's so-called **"status"** value. A zero indicates that the program ran successfully. Any other value indicates that the program failed to run or encountered some problem.

To see function return values in action, let's create a function named Average(). You will find this function in the Average project directory. Average() takes two ints and returns the average of those two values:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int average( int firstNumber, int secondNumber);

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    int averageNumber;
    averageNumber = average(7,23);
    printf("The averag of 7 and 23 is %d\n", averageNumber);
    return 0;
}

int average( int firstNumber, int secondNumber)
{
    return ( firstNumber + secondNumber ) / 2;
}
```

```console
The averag of 7 and 23 is 15
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

Another way to use a function, nested:

```c
(if (average(i,j) > 100))
```

The key thing to remember is that the value of a function call in an expression will be the value returned by the function call in an expression will be the value returned by the function.

# * [printf() Returns a Value](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

You are also within your rights to completely ignore the value returned by a function, like this:

```c
average(2,108)
```

If you write a function call, but ignore its returns value, nothing bad happens. The function executes and the value it returns simply disappears into the mist. For function like average() that would be silly, because the whole purpose of the function is to calculate a value. If you weren't interested in the value, you would not have called the function.

But a lot of functions perform useful tasks while also returning a value, which may or may not be of interest to the caller. It is worth nothing that printf() is actually declared to return an int. The value returned is the number of characters generated, or a negative value if an error occurred. The vast majority of programmers ignore this return value because all they are interested in is getting a message sent to the console. That is all we have cared about so far. But if you ever find yourself in a situation where you want to know exactly how many characters the printf() function sent to the console, all you have to do is observe the value returned by the printf() function call, like this:

```c
int averageNumber;
int lineLenght = printf("The average of 7 and 23 is %d\n", average(7,23));
printf("The previous line is %d characters long\n", lineLenght-1);
```

```console
The average of 7 and 23 is 15
The previous line is 29 characters long
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

# * [Multiple Returns Statements](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Let's create a slightly more complex example that also highlights a feature of **return** statements.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int minimum(int firstNumber, int secondNumber);

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    printf("%d is smaller of 7 an 23\n", minimum(7,23));
    printf("%d is smaller of 23 and 7\n", minimum(23, 7));
}

int minimum(int firstNumber, int secondNumber)
{
    if(firstNumber<secondNumber)
        return firstNumber;
    return secondNumber;
}
```

```console
7 is smaller of 7 an 23
7 is smaller of 23 and 7
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

For a function that returns a value - we will get to functions that don't shortly - the **return** statement expresses what value is to be returned. But the **return** statement has another important attribute: **it ends the function**.

Just as the break statement you send in Chapter 6 will jump out of any remaining code in a loop, the **return** statement jumps out of any remaining code in that function. Typically, you will find a single **return** statement at the very end of the function, as you have been seen in **main()**, where its purpose is to state the value to be returned. But you can have additional **return** statements elsewhere in the function. If a **return** statement is not the last statement, it causes the function to exit immediately and return the stated value to the caller. No further code in the function is performed.

In the minimum() function, the **if** statement determines if the value of **a** is less than the value of **b**. If it is, the **return a**; statement is performed. This causes the value of **a** to be returned as the value for this function and no further statements in minimum are performed.

If **a** is not less than **b**, the statement following the if statement is executed instead. The **return b**; statement causes the value of **b** to be returned. The end result is that the value of the **minimum()** function call will be the smaller of its two argument values.

# * [Return Nothing At All](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Earlier in the book we alluded to the **void** type. The **void** type is a special type that means **nothing** or **no value**. You use it in places to indicate that something does not have any value at all, and **void** has two very important roles in functions.

Both of these roles are illustrated in this function definition from the **hello** project you ran in chapter 3:

```c
void sayHello( void );
```

A return type of void indicates that the function does not return a value. That's it. The function does not pass a value of any kind back to the caller. You can call a function with a **void** return type --called a **void function**--- like this:

```c
sayHello();
```

But you can't use it in an expression, because it has no value:

```c
variable = sayHello(); // error, sayHello() does not return a value
```

The other use of **void** is in the parameter list of a function that does not have any parameters. The definition sayHello(void) means that there are no values passed to sayHello(). When you call sayHello(), you don't put any arguments between the two parentheses.

---
**Note** 
You can still use a **return^** statement in a void function; you just omit the expression. This is sometimes called an **empty return statement**. It will still stop the function and return execution to the function that called it, but no value is passed. 
---

A function can have a return value and no parameters, parameters but no return value, or any combination that makes sense.

---
**TIP**
The compiler will help you use the **return** statement correctly. If you try to use a **return** with an expression in a void function, or forget the expression in a function that returns a value, or just forget the return statement altogether, the compiler will issue a warning. Check for those warnings to make sure you are using the appropiate return statement.

# * [Putting it All Together](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Brace yourself. You are about to use almost everything you have learned about C so far. You have learned about variables, expressions, functions, if statements, loops, pointers, and parameter passing. Now we are going to show a program that uses them all together. 

# * [Using Pointers as Parameters](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Combining the individual pieces of C definitely creates a whole that is more than a sum of its part. The first bit of alchemy we will perform is to combine pointers with function parameters.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <math.h>
```

Prototype function:

```c
bool factor(int number, int *firstFactorPointer, int *secondFactorPointer);
```

In main()

```c
int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
    int number;
    
    for (number=2; number<=20; number++) {
        bool isPrime;
        int firstFactorNumber, secondFactorNumber;
        
        isPrime = factor(number, &firstFactorNumber, &secondFactorNumber);
        if (isPrime)
            printf("The number %d is prime\n", number);
        else
            printf("The number %d has %d and %d as factors\n", number, firstFactorNumber, secondFactorNumber);
        
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Write the function:

```c
bool factor(int number, int *firstFactorPointer, int *secondFactorPointer)
{
    int factor;

    for (factor = sqrt(number); factor > 1; factor--) {
        if ((number % factor ) == 0) {
                break;
        }
    }
    *firstFactorPointer = factor;
    *secondFactorPointer = number / factor;
    return ( factor == 1);
}
```

By this point in your journey to master C, you should understand practically every aspects of this program.

# * [Some Pointers on Pointers](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

There are some finer points (no pun intended) about pointers and parameters that you should know about. These will help you to understand the best ways to use, and maybe when not to use, pointers in your program.

# * [Pass-By-Value vs Pass-By-Reference](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

In the program average(), you passed simple (int) values to the average() function. The values of the argument expressions were copied into the function's parameters before the function executed. The function could change its parameters variables, but that has no effect on the original values. (We know you know all of this, we are just restating it so it is clear).

In programming lingo this is called **pass-by-value**. A copy of the value is passed to the function and the function can do anything it wants to with its copy; it will never affect another variable in the program.

In the Factor project you passed the addresses of two variables. The factor() function was able to use those pointers to affect variables outside its scope. This method of passing values is called **pass-by-reference**. Instead of copying the value, a reference to the value is passed to the function. The function can use this reference to access and/or modify the original value at will.

Whether to use pass-by-value or pass-by-reference is a perennial topic of debate among programmers, in general, our approach is to use pass-by-value unless there is a compelling reason to use pass-by-reference.

Compelling reasons to use pass-by-reference might be

	* The value is a group or collection of values. (this will make sense after you read about arrays in the next chapter)
	* a Function must return more than one value. (there are also other solutions to this particular problem that you will learn about in chapter 9)
	* The amount of data you need to pass to, or from, a function is cumbersome to copy. Remember the library example at the start of the chapter? Even if you could make a copy of an entire book, It is still much easier to give someone the catalog number of the book instead.
	* The information that needs to be passed is a complex collection of values, and the function needs to examine some values and modify numbers others. (Again, this will make more sense after Chapter 9). It is easier to pass a single reference to the whole mess rather than copying every value the function will need.

# * [The NULL Pointer Value](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

The C Language defines a special pointer value named **NULL** that means **"no address"**. You can assign the NULL value to any pointer (pointer == NULL) an you can compare pointer values with NULL, as in if(pointer == NULL). NULL gives you a value that means the pointer does not point any variable at all.

Earlier we stated that memory addresses start at zero and go up, and a variable can be allocated at any address. In practice, **that is not entirely true**. Addresses do start at 0, but OSX and BSD Unix never allocate variables at address 0, or anywhere near address 0. The reason why are many, but the one important is so **that programmers can be guaranteed that no valid variable address will ever be zero.**

The NULL constant is address 0. Assigning NULL to a pointer is the same as setting its integer value to 0. One side effect is that a lot of C programmers use a short-hand for testing to see if a pointer variable points to a value or not 

```c
if(pointer) {
}
```

Remember that an if statement performs its action if the expression is non-zero. Since NULL is always zero and any valid variable address will not be zero, this statement is equivalent to:

```c
if (pointer != null) {
}
```

 We suggest you write out the long form, simply because it makes your intentions clearer; both are common.

# * [The Dark Side of Pointers](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

> With great power comes great responsibility

Pointers are very powerful, but they have a dark side. They occupy a dangerous land full of hazards just waiting to snare an unsuspecting programmer. To correct, and safe, use of pointers requires careful planning and attention to detail.

The principle peril of pointers is that they can point anywhere. There are no safeguards to ensure that a pointer points to the kind of value you expect it to. It can just as easily point another kind of value, or unused memory, or the part of memory where the code for your program is stored, or an address that does not even exist.

The effects of using pointers that point to the wrong thing range from the perplexing to the disastrous. If a pointer points to some other variable, changing it will have a bizarre effect on your program- the value you expected to change will not, and some other unrelated variable will spontaneously change. If the pointer points to memory that does not exist, the hardware will catch it and terminate your program with a **"segment default"** signal, colloquially known as a **"crash"**.

# * [Physical and Logical Memory Address](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

If you are reading this book carefully, you might have detected an inconsistency.

We said that memory addresses start at zero and go up. We said C reserves address 0 (NULL) to mean **"no address"**. We said that if you try to access a memory address that does not exist, your program will crash. But why ? Does not address 0 always exist ? Isn't address 0 the one address in every computer that exists ?

Yes and no. The answer lies in the difference between physical memory addresses and logical memory addresses.

In **physical memory** -The RAM that is soldered to your motherboard- address 0 is the first byte of memory. But your program never addresses physical memory directly. It works with what we are called **logical addresses**.

Modern computers use a system called **virtual memory** that maps (translates) the logical addresses that your program uses into the physical addresses of your RAM. This is done through (surprise!) a bunch of pointers called a **page map**. When your program is started it is allocated a range of logical memory addresses to use. These addresses might start at, say, one million (1,000,000) and go up from there. You will notice that address 0 ins intentionally left out. If your program allocates an integer at address 1,000,000 and stores a value in it, **the CPU uses its page map to translate that logical address into the actual physical address of your RAM**. Don't worry about the complexity of this; It is all handled by hardware and it is mind-numbingly fast.

This arrangement benefits your program in two ways. The first is security. If you accidently use an uninitialized pointer, your program could end up accessing a memory address that's not even part of your program. Imagine if your program could change values in another running program! Well, relax; you can't. Your program can only access the logical addresses that have been assigned to it. Try to access anything outside that range and your program will crash.

The second benefit is simplicity. Every program can allocate its first variable at address 1,000,000. Each program has the same logical addresses, but the page map translates them into different physical addresses. One program does not have to worry about using addresses of another program. Each program lives in its own separate universe, and they never collide.

The short and long of it is that you don't need to worry about it. You will never see the actual (physical) address that your data is stored in. When Programming and debugging, everything will be in the logical addresses allotted to your program.

# * [Tips for staying safe with pointers](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters)

- Make sure your pointer variables are initialized. An uninitialized integer variable simple contains  goofy number, but an uninitialized pointer variable will point to some random, likely invalid location.
- If you don`t have a value to put in a pointer, set it to NULL. Test the pointer to make sure if is not equal to NULL before you use it. Dereferencing a NULL pointer is the fastest, and most common, way to crash your program. If a pointer is no longer valid, set it to NULL again.
- Make sure you don't use pointers to variables that no longer exist. In the Factor project, main() allocated a variable and passed its address to factor(), which used that pointer. The variable existed before, and after, the call to factor() so that was safe. But what happens if you reverse it ? what if factor() allocates a variable and passess its addres back to main() It is unsafe for main() to use that pointer. Why ? Because the variable created by factor() disappeared as soon as the function returned to main(), so the pointer that main() has now points to a varible that no longer exists. That is a recipe for disaster.

Dont feel bad if you make a mistake with pointers, because **you will make a mistake with pointers.**. We doubt there is a C programmer alive that has not crashed their application using a ULL or uninitialized pointer. Professional programmers with decades of experience do it. In fact, it is the number one reason application crash.

# * [Global and Static Variables](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

So far we have used function parameters, return values, and pointers to pass values to and from other functions. We did this  because the scope of an automatic variable is confined to the function (of block) it was declared in. This is, by far, the **most common way that values are passed around inside a program**. There is, however, an alternative.

# * [Global Variables](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

A **global variable** isa variable that is accessible from every function in your program. Said another way, the scope of a global variable is the entire program. The variable is created before the programm begins and exist until it ends.

**Global variables** provide and alternative to passing values via parameters. Global variables are just like regular variables, with the exception that they can be referenced inside any of your program's functions. One function might initialize the the global variable; another might change its value; and another function might print the value of the global variable in the console window.

As you design your programs, you will have to make some basic decisions about **data sharing between functions**. If you will be sharing a variable among a number of functions, you might want to consider making the varible a global. **Globals** are escpecially useful when you want to share a variable between two functions that are several calls apart.

**Several calls apart?** At times, you will find yourself passing a parameter to a function, not because the function needs the parameter, but because the function calls another function that needs that parameter

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void passAlong(int variable);
void printVariable(int variable);

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    int variable;
    
    variable = 10;
    passAlong(variable);
    return 0;
}

void passAlong(int variable)
{
    printVariable(variable);
}

void printVariable(int variable)
{
    printf("variable = %d\n", variable);
}
```

```console
variable = 10
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

Notice that main() passes **variable** tothe function **passAlong()**. **passAlong()** does not actually make use of **variable**. Instead, it just passes **variable** along to the function **printVariable()**. **printVariable(), prints **variable** and then returns. If **variable** were a global, you could have avoided some parameter passing. **main()** and **printVariable** could have **shared variable** without the use of parameters. 

# * [When to use Globals](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

When should you use parameters ? when you should you use globars ?

In a nutshell (cascara), you should generally avoid using globals unless there's a compelling reason to do so. Global variables offer a shorcut that saves you from having to pass information up and down your chain of function calls and gives disparate functions access to the same information. They do save time, but sometimes at the cost of proper program design. As you move on to object progrmming languages like objective-c, you will find that rarely (if ever) need globals.

So why you learn about them ? There are times when a global is absolutely the correct solution. On the other hande, a telitale sign of an inexperienced programmer is overuse of globals.

None of these decisions are cut and dried. There's a very influenctial book title **Design Patters: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Design** written by the **so-called** **"Gang of Four". Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. The book describes common programming problems and elegant solutions to those problems. These **"design patterns"** as they have become known as, are universal and can be applied to just about become familiar with design patterns.

At the same time, people have observed **"anti-patterns"**, bad programming practices, used by poor programmers. Using too many global variables is an anti-pattern, and here is why. **One variable should be available (in scope) to that code that makes use of that variable, and not much else. Functions shouldn't have acess to unrelated variables. A global variable is accessible everywhere, but it is rare to find a variable whose purpose is applicable to every function in your program. As your program get larger, they become even more rare**.
