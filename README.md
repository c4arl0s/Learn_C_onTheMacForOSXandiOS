# 7. [Pointers and Parameters](V)

#	* [Pointers and Parameters](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

For starters, we will introduce the concept of pointers, also known as **references**
Pointers make all modern software possible.

# * [what is a pointer](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

In programming, pointers are **references** to other things. 
When you declare a variable in C, memory is allocated to hold its value. This memory has a specific, numeric address. C pointers are special variables, specifically designed to hold one of these addresses.

# * [Why use pointers](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Pointers can be extremely useful, allowing you to access your data in ways that ordinary variables just don't allow.

In this chapter stars to explaining how a book in a bookstore can be found it.
What really is important to say is that the use of pointers in your C programs is not much different from those models of how a books is find it. Each catalog number points to the location of a book on the library shelf, just as each street address identifies a specific house. In the same way, each pointer in your program will point to the location off a piece of data in computer memory

There is a lot you can do with pointers. By mastering the techniques presented in these next few chapters, you will be able to create programs that take full advantage of pointers

# * [Pointers Basics](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Pointers are address variables. Instead of an address such as 1313 Mockingbird Lane, Raven Heights, California 90263, a variable's address refers to a memory location within your computer. Your computer's memory -also known as **random access memory** (RAM)- consist of a sequence of bytes. One megabyte of RAM has exactly 2^30 (or 1,048,576) bytes of memory, while 8 megabytes of RAM has exactly 8(2^20) = 2^23 = 8,388,608 bytes of memory. 

2^4 = 16
2^8 = 256
2^16 = 65,536
2^32 = 4,294,967,296	that's why my old hp pavilion of 32 bits ran with 4GB of ram memory
2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616	 That's why my macbook of 64 bits can run with 16GB of ram memory

By other hand, the book treats the memory as arbitrary numbers like 1MB of ram, 8 MB of RAM, etc. This does not exist commercially, at least not when I was studying.


Every one of those bytes has a unique **address**.
