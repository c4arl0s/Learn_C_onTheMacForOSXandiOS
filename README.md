# 7. [Pointers and Parameters](V)

#	* [Pointers and Parameters](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

For starters, we will introduce the concept of pointers, also known as **references**
Pointers make all modern software possible.

# * [what is a pointer](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

In programming, pointers are **references** to other things. 
When you declare a variable in C, memory is allocated to hold its value. This memory has a specific, numeric address. C pointers are special variables, specifically designed to hold one of these addresses.

# * [Why use pointers](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Pointers can be extremely useful, allowing you to access your data in ways that ordinary variables just don't allow.

In this chapter stars to explaining how a book in a bookstore can be found it.
What really is important to say is that the use of pointers in your C programs is not much different from those models of how a books is find it. Each catalog number points to the location of a book on the library shelf, just as each street address identifies a specific house. In the same way, each pointer in your program will point to the location off a piece of data in computer memory

There is a lot you can do with pointers. By mastering the techniques presented in these next few chapters, you will be able to create programs that take full advantage of pointers

# * [Pointers Basics](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

Pointers are address variables. Instead of an address such as 1313 Mockingbird Lane, Raven Heights, California 90263, a variable's address refers to a memory location within your computer. Your computer's memory -also known as **random access memory** (RAM)- consist of a sequence of bytes. One megabyte of RAM has exactly 2^30 (or 1,048,576) bytes of memory, while 8 megabytes of RAM has exactly 8(2^20) = 2^23 = 8,388,608 bytes of memory. 

2^4 = 16
2^8 = 256
2^16 = 65,536
2^32 = 4,294,967,296	that's why my old hp pavilion of 32 bits ran with 4GB of ram memory
2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616	 That's why my macbook of 64 bits can run with 16GB of ram memory

By other hand, the book treats the memory as arbitrary numbers like 1MB of ram, 8 MB of RAM, etc. This does not exist commercially, at least not when I was studying.


Every one of those bytes has a unique **address**.

# * [The address of a Variable](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Learn_C_onTheMacForOSXandiOS#7-pointers-and-parameters-1)

When you run a program, one of the first things the computer does is allocate memory for your program's variables. When you declare and Int in your code, like this:

```c
int variable;
```

The compiler reserves memory for the exclusive use of **variable**.

Note: As mentioned earlier in this book, the amount of memory allocated for an Int depends on your development environment, Xcode currently defaults to using 4-byte ints.

Each variable's bytes has a specific address. Figure 7-4 shows the computer's 1 gigabyte of memory.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-29 at 12 38 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/83288670-5e307380-a1a9-11ea-84bd-4a31506c2051.png)

In this picture, the 4 bytes allocated to variable have he addresses 836, 837, 838 and 839.

By convention, a variable's address is said to be the address of its first byte (the first byte is the byte with the lowest numbered address). If a variable uses memory locations 936 through 839, its address is 836 and its length is 4 bytes.

Note: When a variable occupies more than 1 byte of memory, he bytes are always consecutive (next to each other in memory). You will never see an int whose byte adresses are 508, 509, 510 and 695. A variable's bytes are like family, they stick together.

As we showed earlier, a variable's address is a lot like the library catalog number in a library book's catalog entry. Both act as pointers, one to  book on the library self and the other to a variable. From now on, when we use the term "pointer" with respect to a variable, we referring to the variable's address.

Now that you understand what a pointer is, you next goal is to learn how to use pointers in your programs. The next few sections will teach you some valuable pointer programming skills. You will learn how to create a pointer to a variable.

The C language provides you with a few key tools to help yo. These tools come in the form of two special operators: & and *.
